Correlation Congruence for Knowledge Distillation,2019,505,10.1109/ICCV.2019.00511,"Baoyun Peng, Xiao Jin, Jiaheng Liu, Shunfeng Zhou, Yichao Wu, Yu Liu, Dongsheng Li, Zhaoning Zhang","Most teacher-student frameworks based on knowledge distillation (KD) depend on a strong congruent constraint on instance level. However, they usually ignore the correlation between multiple instances, which is also valuable for knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a new framework named correlation congruence for knowledge distillation (CCKD), which transfers not only the instance-level information but also the correlation between instances. Furthermore, a generalized kernel method based on Taylor series expansion is proposed to better capture the correlation between instances. Empirical experiments and ablation studies on image classification tasks (including CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K) and metric learning tasks (including ReID and Face Recognition) show that the proposed CCKD substantially outperforms the original KD and other SOTA KD-based methods. The CCKD can be easily deployed in the majority of the teacher-student framework such as KD and hint-based learning methods."

The Importance of Influencer-Message Congruence When Employing Greenfluencers to Promote Pro-Environmental Behavior,2022,52,10.1080/17524032.2022.2115525,"S. C. Boerman, M. Meijers, Wietske Zwart","ABSTRACT To combat climate change, it is of vital importance that people change their behaviors. This study explores how influencers, or so-called greenfluencers, on Instagram could be utilized to stimulate pro-environmental behavior. We examine the effects of influencer-message congruence on influencer credibility (i.e. trustworthiness and expertise) and pro-environmental intentions, and compare the effects of influencer-message congruence between micro- (1000–10,000 followers) and meso- (10,000–1 million followers) influencers. Results of a 2 (influencer-message: incongruence vs. congruence) × 2 (influencer type: micro- vs. meso-influencer) online experiment amongst 201 Instagram users revealed that influencer-message congruence increased influencer credibility and pro-environmental intentions. Influencer credibility did not appear to be the underlying mechanism of the effect of congruence on pro-environmental intentions. Moreover, influencer type did not moderate the effect of influencer-message congruence. Our results imply that choosing an influencer whose image aligns with the pro-environmental message is important to stimulate Instagram users’ pro-environmental behavior."
"When social media influencers endorse brands: the effects of self-influencer congruence, parasocial identification, and perceived endorser motive",2019,268,10.1080/02650487.2019.1678322,"Yan Shan, K. Chen, J. Lin","Abstract Given the prevalence of social media usage among consumers in China and the rise of social media endorsements, it is important to understand the effects of social media influencers and their product endorsements on consumers. The present study explores the effects of self-influencer congruence on brand attitude, brand engagement, and purchase intention in China’s dynamic social media context. The perceived motive of social media influencer’s endorsement behavior, parasocial identification with social media influencers, and their roles in the endorsement process were examined. The results of this study suggest that a high degree of congruence between the image of a social media influencer and the consumer’s ideal self-image leads to effective endorsement outcomes. Parasocial identification was found to mediate the relationship between self-influencer congruence and endorsement outcomes while perceived endorser motive was found to moderate the effects of self-influencer congruence on such outcomes through parasocial identification."

The effects of celebrity-brand congruence and publicity on consumer attitudes and buying behavior,2019,89,10.1186/s40691-018-0159-8,"Jaehan Min, H. Chang, T. Jai, Morgan Ziegler","Marketers use celebrity endorsements to make advertisements believable and to enhance consumer recognition of the brand name. However, once a direct link has been formed from a celebrity to a brand, the negative information about the celebrity may reflect on to the endorsed brand. Applying the S-O-R model and the balance theory, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of celebrity-brand congruence and publicity on consumers’ attitudes toward the celebrity and brand as well as their buying intention. A survey of a 2 (congruence vs. incongruence) × 2 (positive vs. negative publicity) experimental design was conducted for this study. A total of 120 female Millennial consumers answered the survey and 105 surveys with usable data were collected. The mean age of the participants was 24 years old (SD = 3.28). Results found that the celebrity-brand congruence and publicity play a significant role in consumer behavior related to attitudes toward the celebrity and brand/product, as well as buying intention. Thus, retail marketers need to allocate more investigation into celebrity endorsements that match with brand image that can lead to long-term, positive partnerships."
Response surface analysis with multilevel data: Illustration for the case of congruence hypotheses.,2019,83,10.1037/met0000199,"S. Nestler, Sarah Humberg, Felix D. Schönbrodt","Response surface analysis (RSA) is a statistical approach that enables researchers to test congruence hypotheses; the proposition that the degree of congruence between people's values in 2 psychological constructs should be positively or negatively related to their value in an outcome variable. This is done by estimating a polynomial regression model and using the graph of the model and several parameters as a guide to interpret the resulting regression coefficients in terms of the congruence hypothesis. One problem with using RSA in applied research is that the model and the interpretation of the model's parameters in terms of congruence effects have only been thoroughly developed for single-level data. Here, we present an extension of RSA to multilevel data. Among other things we show how the standard errors can be computed and how researchers can decide whether the occurrence of a congruence effect depends on a Level 2 covariate. We illustrate the suggested extension with 2 examples that guide readers through the test of congruence effects in the case of multilevel data. We also provide R scripts that researchers can adopt to conduct multilevel RSA. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)."
Cognitive and social congruence in peer-assisted learning – A scoping review,2019,86,10.1371/journal.pone.0222224,"Teresa Loda, Rebecca Erschens, H. Loenneker, K. Keifenheim, C. Nikendei, F. Junne, S. Zipfel, Anne Herrmann-Werner","This scoping review presents an overview of cognitive and social congruence in peer assisted learning (PAL), as the positive effects of PAL have been shown to rely on these critical factors. The scoping review followed the guidelines of the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. Databases were systematically searched for articles that focus on PAL and cognitive and social congruence. Participants of the studies included were medical, health science, polytechnic, law and paramedic students. Studies that assessed cognitive and social congruence by questionnaires with a 5-point Likert scale were regarded for meta-analytic pooling. Sixteen of 786 identified articles were included in the review, whereof 9 studies were considered for meta-analytic pooling. The meta-analytic pooling showed that tutees tend to see their student tutors as cognitively (Mweighted = 3.84; range of Mweighted = 2.69–4.56) and socially congruent (Mweighted = 3.95; range of Mweighted = 2.33–4.57). Further, characteristics of student tutors are summarized. This scoping review presents an overview and operationalization of cognitive and social congruence in PAL. Based on the presented meta-analytic pooling, cognitive and social congruence were found to represent relevant key factors in the PAL context. Thus, this theoretical background should be acknowledged as a core concept for tutorials within the medical curriculum."
The value of value congruence.,2009,1275,10.1037/a0014891,"J. Edwards, D. Cable","Research on value congruence has attempted to explain why value congruence leads to positive outcomes, but few of these explanations have been tested empirically. In this article, the authors develop and test a theoretical model that integrates 4 key explanations of value congruence effects, which are framed in terms of communication, predictability, interpersonal attraction, and trust. These constructs are used to explain the process by which value congruence relates to job satisfaction, organizational identification, and intent to stay in the organization, after taking psychological need fulfillment into account. Data from a heterogeneous sample of employees from 4 organizations indicate that the relationships that link individual and organizational values to outcomes are explained primarily by the trust that employees place in the organization and its members, followed by communication, and, to a lesser extent, interpersonal attraction. Polynomial regression analyses reveal that the relationships emanating from individual and organizational values often deviated from the idealized value congruence relationship that underlies previous theory and research. The authors' results also show that individual and organizational values exhibited small but significant relationships with job satisfaction and organizational identification that bypassed the mediators in their model, indicating that additional explanations of value congruence effects should be pursued in future research."
Value Congruence: A Study of Green Transformational Leadership and Employee Green Behavior,2018,133,10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01946,"Xingdong Wang, Kong Zhou, Wenxing Liu","This study examined the extent to which the impact of green transformational leadership on employee green behavior through follower perceptions of value congruence. Path analyzing on data from 193 subordinate-leader dyads showed that followers’ value congruence with their leader mediated the effects of green transformational leadership on employee green behavior. Results also supported that green identity moderated the indirect effect of green transformational leadership on employee green behavior through value congruence, such that the indirect effect was more positive when green identity was high than when it was low. These findings provided valuable contribution to green transformational leadership, value congruence, and employee green behavior by exploring the relationship between them. Practical implications and directions for future research are also discussed."
"Self-Image Congruence, Functional Congruence, and Mobile App Intention to Use",2020,38,10.1155/2020/5125238,"Shuhui Wu, Minglun Ren, Abdul Hameed Pitafi, Tahir Islam","Although the research on the technology acceptance model (TAM) has received much attention, limited research has been done on the role of self-image congruence on the mobile application (app) intention to use. Therefore, leveraging the lens of the self-congruence theory, the primary objective of the present research is to examine the impact of self-image and functional congruence on the mobile app intention to use. We conduct a survey and collect 349 responses from Chinese smartphone users. The results of the current research reveal that self-image congruence is positively significantly related to mobile app intention to use. Also, our findings show that symbolic congruence is a vital determinant of the mobile app intention to use among Chinese smartphone users. Overall, the present study extends the understanding of TAM and concludes that symbolic congruence, such as functional attributes, is equally essential for technology intention to use. Moreover, this study extends the TAM and self-congruence theory literature by empirically investigating and validating the conceptual framework. The present study highlights the significance of self-image congruence to understand the user mobile app adoption behavior better. It provides important knowledge for the app developers, researchers, policymakers, and marketing managers of the famous social commerce and popular brand apps."

Arcelus","Abstract Background: Binary transgender people access gender affirming medical interventions to alleviate gender incongruence and increase body satisfaction. Despite the increase in nonbinary transgender people, this population are less likely to access transgender health services compared to binary transgender people. No research has yet understood why by exploring levels of gender congruence and body satisfaction in nonbinary transgender people. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare levels of gender congruence and body satisfaction in nonbinary transgender people to controls [binary transgender people and cisgender (nontrans) people]. Method: In total, 526 people from a community sample in the UK took part in the study (97 nonbinary, 91 binary, and 338 cisgender identifying people). Participants were asked to complete an online survey about gender congruence and body satisfaction. Results: There were differences in gender congruence and body satisfaction between nonbinary and binary transgender people. On sex-specific parts of the body (i.e., chest, genitalia, and secondary sex characteristics), nonbinary transgender people reported significantly higher levels of gender and body satisfaction compared to binary transgender people. However, there was no difference in congruence and satisfaction with social gender role between the two transgender groups (nonbinary and binary). Cisgender people reported significantly higher levels of gender congruence and body satisfaction compared to transgender people (nonbinary and binary). Conclusions: There are differences in gender congruence and body satisfaction between nonbinary and binary transgender people. Nonbinary individuals may be less likely to access transgender health services due to experiencing less gender incongruence and more body satisfaction compared to binary transgender people. Transgender health services need to be more inclusive of nonbinary transgender people and their support and treatment needs, which may differ from those who identify within the binary gender system."
Congruence between Preferred and Actual Place of Death for Those in Receipt of Home-Based Palliative Care.,2020,36,10.1089/jpm.2019.0582,"Jiaoli Cai, Li Zhang, D. Guerriere, P. Coyte","Background: Understanding the factors that affect the congruence between preferred and actual place of death may help providers offer clients customized end-of-life care settings. Little is known about this congruence for cancer patients in receipt of home-based palliative care. Objectives: This study aims to determine the congruence between preferred and actual place of death among cancer patients in home-based palliative care programs. Design: A longitudinal prospective cohort study was conducted. Congruence between preferred and actual place of death was measured. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the determinants of achieving a preferred place of death. From July 2010 to August 2012, a total of 290 caregivers were interviewed biweekly over the course of their palliative care trajectory from entry to the program and death. Results: The overall congruence between preferred and actual place of death was 71.72%. Home was the most preferred place of death. The intensity of home-based nursing visits and hours of care from personal support workers (PSWs) increased the likelihood of achieving death in a preferred setting. Conclusions: The provision of care by home-based nurse visits and PSWs contributed to achieving a greater congruence between preferred and actual place of death. This finding highlights the importance of formal care providers in signaling and executing the preferences of clients in receipt of home-based palliative care."

Vollmann, Shane van Weelie","The present study investigated the association between transgender congruence and self-esteem in transgender and gender-nonconforming (TGNC) individuals and whether rumination about gender identity atemporally meditates this relationship. In a cross-sectional study, 323 TGNC individuals completed an online survey measuring the 2 factors of transgender congruence (i.e., appearance congruence and gender identity acceptance), rumination about gender identity, and self-esteem. Data were analyzed using a mediation analysis with gender identity acceptance and appearance congruence as predictors, rumination about gender identity as mediator, and self-esteem as outcome. The results revealed positive associations between both factors of transgender congruence and self-esteem. Furthermore, it was found that these relationships were partially atemporally mediated by rumination about gender identity. More specifically, higher levels of appearance congruence and gender identity acceptance were associated with higher levels of self-esteem through less rumination about gender identity. These results suggest that transgender congruence and rumination about gender identity are factors that can be addressed in clinical settings to increase self-esteem and other components of mental health in TGNC individuals."
"Linking actual self-congruence, ideal self-congruence, and functional congruence to donor loyalty: the moderating role of issue involvement",2020,29,10.1007/s11573-020-01006-9,"Adnan Zogaj, D.

Therefore, a deeper understanding of the determinants of donor loyalty is necessary. This study tests whether actual self-congruence, ideal self-congruence, and functional congruence strengthen the tie between nonprofit organizations and donors. In addition, and as an extension of the self-congruence theory, issue involvement is added as a moderator variable. The study results show that ideal self-congruence and functional congruence have a positive effect on donor loyalty, while actual self-congruence does not affect donor loyalty. Moreover, the study results show that issue involvement strengthens (mitigates) the effect of actual self-congruence (ideal self-congruence) on donor loyalty. Regarding the relationship between functional congruence and donor loyalty, issue involvement has no moderating effect. Based on the empirical findings, this study discusses academic implications and presents managerial implications for fundraisers and nonprofit organizations."

Henderson, Marc Mazodier, Aparna Sundar","Brand sponsorship connects brands with large, passionate audiences. The sponsorship literature emphasizes the importance of brand sponsor–team congruence; however, prior research has largely focused on the relevance of the brand to the sport or geographic area. This article offers the first real-world empirical investigation of the effects of visual congruence through color matching on sponsorship performance. A wide-scale study of 703 Major League Baseball fans’ evaluations of their team’s sponsors, merged with real stadium signage data, offers evidence of the benefits of visual congruence. Two experiments in the contexts of product packaging and online advertising provide converging evidence of the positive effects of created visual congruence on attitudes toward the sponsorship, brand attitudes, and intentions. Brands without an inherent match to a team can enjoy enhanced sponsorship benefits with little additional costs simply by adopting the team’s colors in visual displays. However, the viewer’s motivation (fan status), opportunity (fan exposure), and ability (lack of color blindness) to process visual congruence moderates its effectiveness. By using the proposed framework, managers can maximize the value of their sponsorship rights."

While we do not find a direct effect between name congruence and subjective firm valuation, we show that name congruence interacts with relationship conflict to affect valuations in a complex fashion. Implications and contributions of our findings are discussed."
Ideological Congruence and Citizen Satisfaction: Evidence from 25 Advanced Democracies,2017,127,10.1177/0010414016639708,"Quinton Mayne, Armèn Hakhverdian","Ideological congruence is an important and popular measure of the quality of political representation. The closer the match between the preferences of the public and those of elected elites, the better representative democracy is thought to function. Relatively little attention has been paid however to the effects of ideological congruence on political judgement. We address this gap by examining whether citizens use egocentric or sociotropic judgments of congruence to evaluate democratic performance. Using a variety of congruence measures, we find that citizens are unmoved by sociotropic congruence; however, our analyses provide clear evidence that egocentric congruence boosts citizen satisfaction, especially among political sophisticates. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for the study of ideological congruence and political representation."

Satisfaction is reduced by a government that deviates on European integration and redistribution and partly also on social lifestyle, immigration and environmental protection. Furthermore, this analysis identifies the level of political interest as central moderator of this relationship. Satisfaction of citizens with stronger interest in politics suffers more when there is a politically distant government. Combining data from the 2010 Chapel Hill Expert Survey and two waves of the European Social Survey, the analysis builds on information on citizen-government policy congruence of some 45,000 citizens and 31 governments in 15 Western and Central Eastern European countries. The article brings a multidimensional perspective to the study of policy congruence between citizens and governments in a time when the preference structure of parties and citizens has become increasingly complex."
Consumers' self-congruence with a 'Liked' brand: cognitive network influence and brand outcomes,2017,99,10.1108/EJM-07-2015-0442,"E. Wallace, Isabel Buil, L. Chernatony","Purpose 
 
 
 
 
Brand “Likes” on Facebook facilitate self-expression, forming part of consumers’ virtual selves. Yet, consumers’ brand “Likes” may bear little resemblance to their material realities. This paper aims to test similarities of brand image with self-image for Facebook “Likes” to determine whether self-congruence with a “Liked” brand leads to positive offline brand outcomes. It also investigates whether consumers’ perceptions about their Facebook social relations influence self-congruent brand “Likes”. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
A large-scale survey was conducted of regular Facebook users who “Liked” brands. Data from 438 respondents was analysed and hypotheses tested using structural equation modeling. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
Empirical results show that the perceived self-congruence with a “Liked” brand increases with social tie strength. Perceived social tie strength is informed by perceived attitude homophily. When the perceived self-congruence with a “Liked” brand is higher, brand love and word of mouth (WOM) are enhanced. Consumers also have greater brand loyalty and offer more WOM when brands are loved. 
 
 
 
 
Research limitations/implications 
 
 
 
 
Findings demonstrate the influence of consumers’ cognitive network on “Likes” and brand outcomes. Further replication would enhance generalisability. Future research should use a wider sample and investigate other variables. 
 
 
 
 
Practical implications 
 
 
 
 
Findings support managers seeking to grow and analyse Facebook “Likes” by providing insights into brand loyalty, brand love and WOM for “Liked” brands. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
 
The paper addresses the dearth of research exploring how consumers’ perceptions of their Facebook network influence their online brand behaviour and how perceived self-congruence with a “Liked” brand relates to brand outcomes."

Congruence is an aspect of the therapy relationship with two facets, one intrapersonal and one interpersonal. Mindful genuineness, personal awareness, and authenticity characterize the intrapersonal element. The capacity to respectfully and transparently give voice to ones’ experience to another person characterizes the interpersonal component. Although most fully developed in the person-centered tradition, congruence is highly valued in many theoretical orientations. In this article, we define and provide clinical examples of congruence. We also present an original meta-analysis of its relation with psychotherapy improvement. An analysis of 21 studies (k), representing 1,192 patients (N), resulted in a weighted aggregate effect size (r) of .23 (95% confidence interval = [.13, .32]) or an estimated d of .46. Moderators of the association between congruence and outcome are also investigated. In closing, we address patient contributions, limitations of the extant research, diversity considerations, and therapeutic practices that might promote congruence and improve psychotherapy outcomes."

To explore the relationships between work environment, value congruence and nurses' work outcomes; as well as to test the moderating effects of value congruence.


BACKGROUND
A poor nursing work environment in most of mainland China has negatively influenced nurses' job satisfaction, burnout and turnover intention. New insights such as improving nurses' value congruence should be proposed to better foster nurses.


METHODS
Cross-sectional data were selected from the Chinese Nurses' Environment of Work Status study. In total, 19149 valid samples were collected. Hierarchical regression analyses and simple slope analyses were performed.


RESULTS
The correlation coefficients of the variables were all significant (p < .01) and in the expected direction. Value congruence moderated the relationship between nursing work environment and burnout (emotional exhaustion: β = 0.106, p < .01; depersonalization: β = 0.111, p < .01).


CONCLUSIONS
Nursing work environment and value congruence were positively related to job satisfaction, and negatively related to burnout and turnover intention. The adverse impact of poor work environment on nurses' burnout can be buffered if nurses' value congruence is compatible with that of the organisation.


IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT
Except for improving the organisational characteristics, value congruence is a useful concept that managers can leverage to improve positive outcomes for both the organisation and its nurses."
Cross‐lagged relations between perceived leader–employee value congruence and leader identification,2018,31,10.1111/joop.12192,"A. F. Marstand, O. Epitropaki, Robin Martin","Building on similarity-attraction theory and extending research on person-organization value congruence and organizational identification, this study examines the relationship between perceived leader-employee value congruence and leader identification. Using a two-wave design, data was collected twice with a six months’ time lag from a sample of 282 employees. Utilizing cross-lagged analyses, we examined bidirectional effects between perceived leader-employee value congruence and leader identification. The results provided support for the positive relationship of perceived leader-employee value congruence (Time 1) to leader identification (Time 2) but could not exclude the possibility of a bidirectional relationship. Overall, the study highlights the importance of value congruence for identification processes."

Rahman, Imanol Belausteguigoitia","We add to human resource literature by investigating how the contribution of task conflict to employee creativity depends on employees’ learning orientation and their goal congruence with organizational peers. We postulate a positive relationship between task conflict and employee creativity and predict that this relationship is augmented by learning orientation but attenuated by goal congruence. We also argue that the mitigating effect of goal congruence is more salient among employees who exhibit a low learning orientation. Our results, captured from employees and their supervisors in a large, Mexican-based organization, confirm these hypotheses. The findings have important implications for human resource managers who seek to foster creativity among employees. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Polynomial regression combined with the response surface methodology was used to test the hypotheses. Findings – Four conclusions were drawn. First, leader-member exchange (LMX) was higher when leaders and followers were aligned in terms of workplace loneliness than otherwise. Second, in the case of leader-follower congruence, LMX rose as their workplace loneliness fell. Third, in the case of incongruence, followers had lower LMX when they were lonelier than their leaders. Finally, LMX partially mediated the leader-fol..."
Revisiting the ideological congruence controversy,2016,67,10.1111/1475-6765.12127,Benjamin Ferland,"One of the limits of previous studies using respondents’ self-placements and subjective party placements to examine levels of citizen-government congruence is that they were limited to the post-1995 period. This article extends the number of elections where it is possible to examine levels of citizen-government ideological congruence with a survey-based approach. In particular, a unique dataset has been collected that combines data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems and several national election studies. The results confirm recent studies that show that levels of citizen-government ideological congruence are similar under majoritarian and proportional representation (PR) systems. Such studies, however, did not provide evidence that congruence is maintained over the course of a government's mandate. This article introduces, therefore, two measures of citizen-government congruence that address this issue and that may revive the debate about which electoral systems strengthen the citizen-government connection: citizen-government congruence at the end of government mandates and change in congruence between elections. The results indicate that governments stay closer to the median citizens between elections under PR systems than under majoritarian systems. It is found, however, that this decrease in congruence in majoritarian systems is not detrimental to the point of observing smaller levels of congruence at the end of government mandates under majoritarian systems than under PR systems."

Baudry, Liangtao Li, Changliu Wang, J. Axmacher","High cross-taxon congruence in species diversity patterns is essential for the use of surrogate taxa in biodiversity conservation, but presence and strength of congruence in species turnover patterns and the relative contributions of abiotic environmental factors and biotic interaction towards this congruence, remain poorly understood. In our study, we used variation partitioning in multiple regressions to quantify cross-taxon congruence in community dissimilarities of vascular plants, geometrid and arciinid moths and carabid beetles, subsequently investigating their respective underpinning by abiotic factors and biotic interactions. Significant cross-taxon congruence observed across all taxon pairs was linked to their similar responses towards elevation change. Changes in the vegetation composition were closely linked to carabid turnover, with vegetation structure and associated microclimatic conditions proposed causes of this link. In contrast, moth assemblages appeared to be dominated by generalist species whose turnover was weakly associated with vegetation changes. Overall, abiotic factors exerted a stronger influence on cross-taxon congruence across our study sites than biotic interactions. The weak congruence in turnover observed particularly between plants and moths highlights the importance of multi-taxon approaches based on groupings of taxa with similar turnovers, rather than the use of single surrogate taxa or environmental proxies, in biodiversity assessments."
The Study of Congruence in Organizational Behavior Research: Critique and a Proposed Alternative,1994,1190,10.1006/OBHD.1994.1029,J. Edwards,"Abstract Numerous studies in organizational behavior research have examined the congruence (i.e., fit, match, agreement, similarity) between two constructs as a predictor of some outcome. The vast majority of these studies have operationalized congruence by collapsing two or more measures into a single index, such as an algebraic, absolute, or squared difference, or an index of profile similarity (D, D2, etc.). Unfortunately, these indices present numerous substantive and methodological problems that severely threaten the interpretability and conclusiveness of the obtained results. This article summarizes problems with congruence indices, presents an alternative approach that overcomes these problems, and illustrates this approach using data from two samples. Recommendations regarding the use and further development of this approach are offered."

The literature only reports rules of thumb. The present article repeats and broadens the approach used in the study by Haven and ten Berge (1977). It aims to find a critical congruence level on the basis of judgments of factor similarity by practitioners of factor analysis. Our results suggest that a value in the range .85-.94 corresponds to a fair similarity, while a value higher than .95 implies that the two factors or components compared can be considered equal."
Perceived Odor-Taste Congruence Influences Intensity and Pleasantness Differently.,2016,32,10.1093/chemse/bjw078,"Sherlley Amsellem, K. Ohla","The role of congruence in cross-modal interactions has received little attention. In most experiments involving cross-modal pairs, congruence is conceived of as a binary process according to which cross-modal pairs are categorized as perceptually and/or semantically matching or mismatching. The present study investigated whether odor-taste congruence can be perceived gradually and whether congruence impacts other facets of subjective experience, that is, intensity, pleasantness, and familiarity. To address these questions, we presented food odorants (chicken, orange, and 3 mixtures of the 2) and tastants (savory-salty and sour-sweet) in pairs varying in congruence. Participants were to report the perceived congruence of the pairs along with intensity, pleasantness, and familiarity. We found that participants could perceive distinct congruence levels, thereby favoring a multilevel account of congruence perception. In addition, familiarity and pleasantness followed the same pattern as the congruence while intensity was highest for the most congruent and the most incongruent pairs whereas intensities of the intermediary-congruent pairs were reduced. Principal component analysis revealed that pleasantness and familiarity form one dimension of the phenomenological experience of odor-taste pairs that was orthogonal to intensity. The results bear implications for the understanding the behavioral underpinnings of perseverance of habitual food choices."

In particular, the study drew on social adaptation and attribution theories to develop hypotheses related to the impact of this congruence on consumers’ perceptions of endorser credibility and suitability, and the subsequent impact of these perceptions on consumers’ attitudes and intentions. The study was motivated by recent attention being paid to the importance of personality in choosing celebrities for product endorsements and the fact that the brand personality–celebrity endorser personality congruence has not been explored before. The model was tested based on data obtained from a sample of participants in India. Results from path analyses indicated a positive and significant impact of personality-based congruence on endorser credibility and suitability, which, in turn, positively and significantly impacted ad believability. Ad believability in turn significantly impacted attitude toward the ad, which had a significant impact on brand attitude and purchase intentions.

The present study had 2 aims: (a) to implement West and Kenny's (2011) Truth-and-Bias model to simultaneously assess the temporal congruence and directional discrepancy between clients' and therapists' ratings of the bond facet of the therapeutic alliance, as they cofluctuate from session to session; and (b) to examine whether symptom severity and a personality disorder (PD) diagnosis moderate congruence and/or discrepancy.


METHOD
Participants included 213 clients treated by 49 therapists. At pretreatment, clients were assessed for a PD diagnosis and completed symptom measures. Symptom severity was also assessed at the beginning of each session, using client self-reports. Both clients and therapists rated the therapeutic bond at the end of each session.


RESULTS
Therapists and clients exhibited substantial temporal congruence in their session-by-session bond ratings, but therapists' ratings tended to be lower than their clients' across sessions. Additionally, therapeutic dyads whose session-by-session ratings were more congruent also tended to have a larger directional discrepancy (clients' ratings being higher). Pretreatment symptom severity and PD diagnosis did not moderate either temporal congruence or discrepancy at the dyad level; however, during sessions when clients were more symptomatic, therapist and client ratings were both farther apart and tracked each other less closely.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings are consistent with a ""better safe than sorry"" pattern, which suggests that therapists are motivated to take a vigilant approach that may lead both to underestimation and to attunement to fluctuations in the therapeutic bond."

The need to maintain diversity turnover among sites, so-called beta-diversity, has also been raised in theoretical and applied ecology. In this study, we propose the first comprehensive framework for the large-scale mapping of taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity and of their respective turnover. Using high-resolution data on the spatial distribution and abundance of birds at a country scale, we disentangled areas of mismatches and congruencies between biodiversity components. We further revealed unequal representation of each component in protected areas: functional diversity was significantly under-represented whereas taxonomic diversity was significantly over-represented in protected areas. Our results challenge the use of any one diversity component as a surrogate for other components and stress the need to adopt an integrative approach to biodiversity conservation."

Is There a Nonprofit Advantage? Examining the Impact of Institutional Context on Individual–Organizational Value Congruence,2015,60,10.1111/PUAR.12357,"Shuyang Peng, Sheela Pandey, S. Pandey","This article addresses an important question: do nonprofit organizations have an advantage over public organizations in fostering individual–organizational value congruence? The authors argue that nonprofit organizations do have an advantage. This is because institutional differences between the two sectors become manifest through nonprofit status and the extent of external control, which influences the organization and the individual. External control and sector status (nonprofit versus public) determine the extent of centralization, organizational goal ambiguity, and work autonomy. In turn, these three organizational characteristics shape individual–organizational value congruence. Although the results provide support for the nonprofit advantage thesis, it is worth noting that organizational effects on individual–organizational value congruence are more powerful. Indeed, the results suggest that managerial and organizational actions, compared with sector status, are more likely to influence individual–organizational value congruence."

It Is a Match: The Impact of Congruence between Celebrity Image and Consumer Ideal Self on Endorsement Effectiveness,2012,605,10.1002/MAR.20550,"S. Choi, Nora J. Rifon","Using celebrities for promoting products is a popular advertising strategy. The selection of celebrity endorsers is of great concern to advertisers given the large sums of money to secure their participation. To date, most academic research on celebrity endorser effectiveness has focused on endorser characteristics (e.g., source credibility) or a match between a product and the endorser (e.g., match-up hypothesis). The study presented here introduces a new dimension for understanding celebrity endorser effects, the congruence between a consumer’s perception of a celebrity’s personality characteristics with the consumer’s self-concept. Consumers’ self-concept is an important influence on purchase decisions (Ericksen, 1997; Graeff, 1996; Sirgy, 1982, 1985), and advertising has been viewed as the most effective tool for creating product images in relation to such self-concept (Sirgy, 1982). Drawn from the two streams of literature, this study proposes and tests an integrative model of celebrity endorsement by examining congruence effects of consumer self-concept and celebrity as well as product and celebrity. Results suggest that ideal congruity (congruence between consumers’ ideal self-image and celebrity image) adds explanatory power to a congruence model of celebrity endorser effects. Implications for advertisers and suggestions for future research are discussed. C ! 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Multiplex congruence network of natural numbers,2015,29,10.1038/srep23714,"Xiao-Yong Yan, Wenxu Wang, Guanrong Chen, Dinghua Shi","Congruence theory has many applications in physical, social, biological and technological systems. Congruence arithmetic has been a fundamental tool for data security and computer algebra. However, much less attention was devoted to the topological features of congruence relations among natural numbers. Here, we explore the congruence relations in the setting of a multiplex network and unveil some unique and outstanding properties of the multiplex congruence network. Analytical results show that every layer therein is a sparse and heterogeneous subnetwork with a scale-free topology. Counterintuitively, every layer has an extremely strong controllability in spite of its scale-free structure that is usually difficult to control. Another amazing feature is that the controllability is robust against targeted attacks to critical nodes but vulnerable to random failures, which also differs from ordinary scale-free networks. The multi-chain structure with a small number of chain roots arising from each layer accounts for the strong controllability and the abnormal feature. The multiplex congruence network offers a graphical solution to the simultaneous congruences problem, which may have implication in cryptography based on simultaneous congruences. Our work also gains insight into the design of networks integrating advantages of both heterogeneous and homogeneous networks without inheriting their limitations."

In this decision-making process, preferences for participation are important. In this systematic review we aim to provide an overview the literature related to the congruence between patients’ preferences and their perceived participation in medical decision-making. We also explore the direction of mismatched and outline factors associated with congruence.MethodsA systematic review was performed on patient participation in medical decision-making. Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library databases up to September 2012, were searched and all studies were rigorously critically appraised. In total 44 papers were included, they sampled contained 52 different patient samples.ResultsMean of congruence between preference for and perceived participation in decision-making was 60% (49 and 70 representing 25th and 75th percentiles). If no congruence was found, of 36 patient samples most patients preferred more involvement and of 9 patient samples most patients preferred less involvement. Factors associated with preferences the most investigated were age and educational level. Younger patients preferred more often an active or shared role as did higher educated patients.ConclusionThis review suggests that a similar approach to all patients is not likely to meet patients’ wishes, since preferences for participation vary among patients. Health care professionals should be sensitive to patients individual preferences and communicate about patients’ participation wishes on a regular basis during their illness trajectory."

Russell,"This article develops and tests a conceptual framework for the practice of product placement. The empirical testing introduces a controlled experimental approach called the theater methodology. Results show that the modality of presentation (visual and auditory) of the placements and the degree of connection between a brand and the plot of the show interact to influence memory and attitude change. Memory improves when modality and plot connection are incongruent but persuasion is enhanced by congruency. While congruous placements appear natural, incongruent placements adversely affect brand attitudes because they seem out of place and are discounted."

This has led to what has become known as the �ideological congruence controversy�. G. Bingham Powell claims to resolve this controversy in favour of PR systems. Specifically, he argues that the results from the two new studies are based on an anomalous decade and that PR systems generally do produce greater government congruence. In addition, he also asserts that PR systems exhibit less variability in government congruence. In this article, the empirical evidence for these two claims is re-evaluated using exactly the same data as employed by Powell. The analysis indicates that although PR systems produce better and more consistent representation in the legislature, they do not hold an advantage when it comes to representation at the governmental level."

Study 1 found the integration measures were related to each other and to inventory measures of health and well-being. Study 2 showed that these goal integration measures were also related to role system integration and were prospective predictors of daily mood, vitality, and engagement in meaningful as opposed to distracting activities."

We contribute to this literature by conceiving the alignment between citizens and political elites as congruence on issues that individual citizens consider important (salience-based congruence). Furthermore, we approach salience from the citizen’s perspective and measure it at the individual level. Based on data from the Swiss Election Study (2007), we demonstrate that the assessment of party representation changes once we take salience into account. Policy congruence on salient issues is high and niche parties perform better than mainstream parties. Our arguments and findings about the role personal issue salience plays at the individual and party levels have important repercussions for contemporary debates on representation and policy congruence."
Cross‐taxon congruence in lake plankton largely independent of environmental gradients,2014,38,10.1890/13-2141.1,"Korhan Özkan, E. Jeppesen, T. Davidson, M. Søndergaard, T. Lauridsen, R. Bjerring, L. Johansson, Jens‐Christian Svenning","Groups of organisms often have congruent patterns of diversity or community structure due to similar environmental requirements. However, ecological interactions across trophic levels may also promote congruence independent of environmental drivers through selective predation, niche partitioning, or facilitation. We examined congruence between phytoplankton and zooplankton communities using 20 years of monitoring data from 17 Danish lakes, most of which were subject to external nutrient loading reduction after a period of eutrophication. Linear mixed effect models and partial Mantel tests were used to elucidate the extent to which congruence in genus richness and composition was driven by environmental factors. Congruence not explained by environmental controls might indicate ecological interactions across trophic levels of lake plankton. Genus richness and composition of phyto- and zooplankton were significantly congruent. Environmental factors had limited power to explain the genus richness of phyto- and zooplankton (R2: 6% and 12%, respectively). Including richness of the reciprocal group among the predictors markedly improved each respective model and explanatory power (R2: 11% and 17%, respectively). Similarly, a large proportion of the congruence in genus composition was independent of environmental dissimilarity (Mantel r: 0.29 and partial Mantel r after accounting for environmental control: 0.17). The strength of the congruence varied among different groups of phyto- and zooplankton, likely reflecting that the different zooplankton groups differ in their grazing size spectra and thus in the strength of their coupling with the phytoplankton assemblages. Remarkably, congruence with phytoplankton was strongest for the smallest group of zooplankton, rotifers, which graze on a limited size spectrum of phytoplankton. Moreover, congruence was stronger in low-nutrient lakes, suggesting that the strength of the interactions between the two groups weakens with eutrophication. This is likely due to changes in trophic dynamics, where enhanced fish predation on large-bodied zooplankton with increasing nutrient levels results in reduced zooplankton grazing control of phytoplankton assemblages."

As we demonstrate, empirical results regarding ideological congruence can depend on exactly how scholars conceptualize and measure it. In addition to clarifying various aspects of how scholars currently conceptualize congruence, we introduce a new conceptualization and measure of congruence that captures a long tradition in democratic theory emphasizing the ideal of having a legislature that accurately reflects the preferences of the citizenry as a whole. Our new measure is the direct counterpart for congruence of the vote-seat disproportionality measures so heavily used in comparative studies of representation. Using particularly appropriate data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems, we find that governments in proportional democracies are not substantively more congruent than those in majoritarian democracies. Proportional democracies are, however, characterized by more representative legislatures."

A theory of debt and equity: diversity of securities and manager-shareholder congruence,1994,918,10.2307/2118355,"M. Dewatripont, J. Tirole","This paper shows how the optimal financial structure of a firm complements incentive schemes to discipline managers, and how the securities’ return streams determine the claim-holders’ incentives to intervene in management. The theory rationalizes (1) the multipUcity of securities, (2) the observed correlation between return streams and control rights of securities, and (3) the partial congruence between managerial and equity-holder preferences over policy choices and monetary rewards as well as the low level of interference of equity in management. The theory also offers new prospects for a reappraisal of the earlier corporate finance literature."

Leader-team congruence in power distance values and team effectiveness: the mediating role of procedural justice climate.,2013,190,10.1037/a0034269,"Michael S. Cole, Min Z. Carter, Zhen Zhang","We examine the effect of (in)congruence between leaders' and teams' power distance values on team effectiveness. We hypothesize that the (in)congruence between these values would differentially predict team effectiveness, with procedural justice climate serving as a mediator. Using multisource data and polynomial regression, we found that similarities (and differences) between leaders' and their teams' power distance values can have consequential effects on teams' justice climate and, ultimately, their effectiveness (viz., team performance and team organizational citizenship behavior). We conclude that to fully understand the implications of power distance, one should consider the multiple perspectives of both leaders and team members."
Celebrities in Advertising: Looking for Congruence or Likability?,2012,315,10.1002/MAR.20551,"Nathalie Fleck, Michaël Korchia, I. L. Roy","The choice of a celebrity endorser for a brand is an important topic in advertising and marketing, as considerable time and effort resources are dedicated to finding the right celebrity to represent a given organization. Celebrities used as endorsers in advertisements are often very popular ones. However, from a cognitive point of view (and a more academic one), congruence between brand and celebrity seems to be very important too. Based on affective and cognitive theories to explain endorsement effectiveness, congruence between brand and celebrity is shown to be as effective as celebrity likability. Moreover, congruence between brand and celebrity as well as celebrity likability have an impact on the predisposition toward the ad, which in turn influences brand beliefs and purchase intention.

"Usefulness, Enjoyment, and Self‐Image Congruence: The Adoption of e‐Book Readers",2013,122,10.1002/MAR.20612,"C. Anton, C. Camarero, Javier Rodríguez","One challenge when launching new technologies is to overcome consumer resistance to change so as to accelerate market acceptance. This is the case of e-book readers. The present study investigates individuals’ perceptions of the utilitarian and hedonic values of such devices and their congruence with self-image as determinants of adoption. Additionally, consumer profile and familiarity with the new technology as a whole influence individuals’ perceptions of this particular technology and its congruence with self-image. Findings show that perceived enjoyment and self-image congruence complement perceived usefulness in forging a favorable attitude toward e-book readers and adoption intention, and that knowledge proves essential in the adoption process. Moreover, people highly involved with reading tend to perceive e-book readers as useless, which hampers their adoption."

Piccolo, Ashley W. Sutton","Using multilevel structural equations modeling, we examine the extent to which the influence of transformational leadership on work group effectiveness flows through follower perceptions of person-organization or person-supervisor value congruence. Results indicate that the group-level effect of transformational leadership on work group effectiveness was fully accounted for by the group-level impact of transformational leadership on follower perceptions of person-organization value congruence, not by its impact on follower perceptions of person-supervisor value congruence. These results are discussed in the context of leadership as a “sense-making” process and the practical barriers faced by transformational leaders in modern organizations."

With the patient supine, the knees are flexed 45 degrees over the end of the table and the legs are supported. The central x-ray beam is inclined downward 30 degrees from the horizontal to strike the film cassette (placed distal to the patellae) at a right angle. The congruence angle , which measures the relationship of the patellar articular ridge to the intercondylar sulcus, was created to measure patellofemoral joint congruence. More than 16 degrees of lateral subluxation of the patella was found to be abnormal at the ninety-fifth percentile in 100 normal subjects."

Emotional congruence with children and sexual offending against children: a meta-analytic review.,2013,58,10.1037/a0033248,"I. Mcphail, Chantal A. Hermann, K. Nunes","OBJECTIVE
Emotional congruence with children is an exaggerated affective and cognitive affiliation with children that is posited to be involved in the initiation and maintenance of sexual offending against children. The current meta-analysis examined the relationship between emotional congruence with children and sexual offending against children, sexual recidivism, and change following sexual offender treatment.


METHOD
A systematic literature review of online academic databases, conference proceedings, governmental agency websites, and article, book chapter, and book reference lists was performed. Thirty studies on emotional congruence with children in sexual offenders against children (SOC) were included in a random-effects meta-analysis.


RESULTS
Extrafamilial SOC-especially those with male victims--evidenced higher emotional congruence with children than most non--SOC comparison groups and intrafamilial SOC. In contrast, intrafamilial SOC evidenced less emotional congruence with children than many of the non-SOC comparison groups. Higher levels of emotional congruence with children were associated with moderately higher rates of sexual recidivism. The association between emotional congruence with children and sexual recidivism was significantly stronger in extrafamilial SOC samples (d = 0.58, 95% CI [0.31, 0.85]) compared with intrafamilial SOC samples (d = -0.15, 95% CI [-0.58, 0.27]). Similarly, emotional congruence with children showed a significant reduction from pre- to posttreatment for extrafamilial SOC (d = 0.41, 95% CI [0.33, 0.85]), but not for intrafamilial SOC (d = 0.06, 95% CI [-0.10, 0.22]).


CONCLUSIONS
Emotional congruence with children is a characteristic of extrafamilial SOC, is moderately predictive of sexual recidivism, and is potentially amenable through treatment efforts."
